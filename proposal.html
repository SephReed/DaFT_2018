			<h1>Description</h1>

			<h2>Brief</h2>
			The shape of this effigy is based off a Pine Cone because pine cones spread their seed by fire.  On the inside we will be playing with themes of light and dark, and mortality.  It is a three story


			<h2>The participant story</h2>
			This year we are attempting to lead participants through something like a story by having a very clear entrance which winds it's way through scenes before reaching a soft end.  The story starts off with a set of stairs that wrap around the build and lead into an entrance on the back....

			<h2>Planned Features</h2>
			Forest, Underground, Cloud lounge, Flame canon spires, Fire garden, Ambience, Afterlife Performers, Water Feature
